## 📖 Technical Documentation

This section will be maintained long-term. It is written based on Hyper-V related documentation and development practices, and may contain inaccuracies.

### Introduction to Hyper-V
> [!NOTE]
> Hyper-V is a high-performance virtual machine manager (Hypervisor) based on Type-1 architecture.

When you enable the Hyper-V feature, the host system becomes a privileged virtual machine belonging to the Root Partition. The created virtual machines belong to Child Partitions; they are isolated from each other and cannot perceive each other's existence.

Virtualization technologies belonging to the Type-1 architecture include: Hyper-V, Proxmox (KVM), VMware ESXi (VMkernel), Xen, etc., with performance utilization rates generally above 98%.

Virtualization technologies belonging to the Type-2 architecture include: VMware Workstation, Oracle VirtualBox, Parallels Desktop, etc., with performance utilization rates around 90%~95%.

Based on these facts, you can view virtual machines as isolated small rooms where you can run potentially threatening programs, test system functions, multi-box games, or other uses without worrying about messing up the host system (Except in cases where FLR is not supported in PCIe Passthrough, where a VM restart might restart the host, or viruses with lateral movement capabilities—please pay attention to network security).

You can enable/disable Hyper-V via the Control Panel or a simple Powershell command (requires Pro or Server edition). After confirming with Y and rebooting, processes like vmms.exe, vmcompute.exe, and vmmem will run continuously in the background, and the Hyper-V Manager icon will appear in the Start menu.

### Scheduler
> [!NOTE]
> The scheduler coordinates how physical processor CPU time is allocated to virtual machine processors.

Hyper-V has three types of schedulers: Classic / Core / Root. They can be categorized into two types: Manual (Classic, Core) and Automatic (Root). Core can be seen as a variant of Classic that improves security but may reduce performance in some scenarios.

The **Classic Scheduler** dates back to Windows Server 2008. It is based on the principle of fair allocation using traditional time slicing. It randomly allocates VM processor time to any available logical processor on the host. If host resources are idle, it is more likely to allocate logical processors from different physical cores rather than hyper-threads to achieve better performance.

The **Core Scheduler** appeared later, introduced in Windows Server 2016 and Windows 10 Build 14393. Its purpose is to mitigate side-channel attacks. Even if host resources are idle, it tends to allocate two threads of the same physical core rather than more physical cores. This strategy helps improve security and VM isolation but significantly reduces the CPU performance allocated to VMs when host resources are idle. Starting from Windows Server 2019, Windows Server defaults to using the Core Scheduler.

The **Root Scheduler** was released in Windows 10 Build 17134. It collects metrics on workload CPU usage and makes automatic scheduling decisions. It is very suitable for hybrid CPU architectures (Big/Little cores). Starting from Build 17134, Windows Hyper-V (Pro) defaults to using the Root Scheduler.

The system type is independent of the scheduler type; you can switch arbitrarily, effective after rebooting the host.

### Processor (vCPU)
> [!NOTE]
> The ability of the virtual machine to request execution time on logical processors from the host.

#### Compute Resources

##### Core Count

Usually set to even numbers like 2, 4, 8, 16.

Increasing vCPUs significantly improves the processing speed of parallel tasks, but too many unnecessary vCPUs may bring scheduling pressure to the Hypervisor.

If the total number of VM cores exceeds the host's physical logical core count (Overselling), applications requiring immediate response will be greatly affected.

##### Reserve

The lower limit percentage of execution time provided for this virtual machine. Reserve Value = Reserve * Core Count.

##### Limit

The upper limit percentage of execution time provided for this virtual machine. Limit Value = Limit * Core Count.

##### Weight

The priority of this virtual machine in competing for CPU execution time, ranging from 0 to 10000.

#### Advanced Features

##### Host Resource Protection

When enabled, it monitors I/O requests communicated through VMBus. If abnormal behavior such as interrupt storms occurs, it reduces CPU execution time allocation to prevent affecting the host system in the root partition. Ordinary users do not need to enable this.

##### Nested Virtualization

When enabled, it passes through the CPU's VT-x/AMD-V instruction set extensions, allowing you to run a virtual machine inside a Hyper-V virtual machine. This slightly increases CPU virtualization overhead.

After enabling Nested Virtualization and Hyper-V features in the VM, the VM's Task Manager will show L1/L2/L3 cache topology and will no longer be marked as "Virtual Machine: Yes," which helps with avoiding virtualization detection.

<div align="center">
<img width="616" height="487" alt="image" src="https://github.com/Justsenger/ExHyperV/blob/main/img/NestedVirtualization.png?raw=true" />
</div>

##### Migration Compatibility

When enabled, it masks part of the CPU instruction set—exactly which part depends on [cpu-migration-compatibility.md](doc/cpu-migration-compatibility.md)—to facilitate live migration across hosts with different hardware. Ordinary users do not need to enable this.

##### Legacy System Compatibility

When enabled, it significantly strips down the CPU instruction set. This is beneficial for running Windows 7 or earlier operating systems but detrimental to running modern operating systems.

##### Virtual Machine SMT

When enabled, the virtual machine can perceive that its vCPUs appear as paired logical cores, helping the OS kernel inside the VM to better perform L1/L2 cache optimization and process scheduling.

##### Expose Architecture Performance Monitoring Unit

When enabled, it passes through the CPU's hardware counters, allowing development tools inside the virtual machine to directly access physical CPU performance monitoring hardware. Requires host support.

##### Expose Frequency Monitoring Registers

When enabled, allows the virtual machine operating system to read the actual frequency of the physical processor. Default is enabled.

##### Disable Side-Channel Attack Mitigations

When enabled, disables the IBRS / IBRS_ALL / STIBP / IBPB / SSBD / MD_CLEAR / TSX_CTRL features. This slightly improves performance but reduces virtualization security.

##### Enable Socket Topology

When enabled, the virtual machine's socket topology follows the host's physical sockets, so the VM can perform NUMA scheduling based on the real sockets.

##### APIC Mode

- Auto (default, let Hyper-V choose)
- xAPIC (legacy, MMIO access, 8-bit APIC ID → addresses up to 255)
- x2APIC (newer, MSR access, 32-bit APIC ID → addresses a huge number of processors)
- Apic (both xAPIC and x2APIC coexist; the VM boots in xAPIC and can switch to x2APIC at runtime)

##### Custom CPU Name

Allows customizing the CPU name, a maximum 48-byte ASCII string. Requires at least Build 20348.

##### CPU Pinning

CPU Pinning is implemented based on CPU Groups (Classic + Core schedulers) + Process Affinity (Root scheduler), allowing you to forcibly lock vCPUs to specified cores.

The best practice is binding 4 vCPUs to 4 cores. Binding 2 vCPUs to 4 cores will cause random drift, and binding 4 vCPUs to 2 cores will cause queuing, and so on.

If you find the scheduler performance poor, or have concerns about Intel's hybrid architecture or AMD's multi-chip architecture, please try using this feature.

> [!CAUTION]
> The following are experimental features. Use with caution.

##### L3 Cache Ways

Manually specify the L3 cache ways the virtual machine sees. When hosts in a cluster have different L3 geometries, fixing the VM's L3 ways to a constant lets cache-topology-aware software inside the VM see consistent cache information before and after migration.

##### L3 Processor Distribution Policy

Decides how vCPUs use the L3 domains. Four policies (Small to Large / Large to Small / Even·Small to Large / Even·Large to Small):

- "Small to Large / Large to Small": prefer allocating the smaller / larger L3 domain.
- "Even": spread vCPUs across the L3 domains as evenly as possible.

##### Page Shattering

Decides the shattering policy of SLAT (Second-Level Address Translation).

- Always shatter: SLAT always uses 4KB small pages.
- Never shatter: use large pages whenever possible.
- Default: decided by the platform and isolation mode.

##### Ignore Host Max Frequency

Lifts the host's frequency cap on the virtual machine. Requires CPU support for frequency-scaling delegation.

##### Expose PMU / LBR / PEBS / IPT

Passes the physical CPU's performance-monitoring hardware through to the virtual machine, for use by profiling and debugging tools inside the VM. Requires host support.

- PMU: hardware performance counters (cycles, instructions, cache hits / misses, branch mispredicts, etc.).
- LBR: Last Branch Record, reconstructs hot call paths.
- PEBS: Precise Event-Based Sampling, pins events to the exact triggering instruction.
- IPT: Processor Trace, low-overhead recording of the full execution control flow.

##### Frequency Cap / Floor / Target (MHz)

Set the virtual machine's CPU running frequency. Requires CPU support for frequency-scaling delegation.

- Cap: frequency will not exceed this value.
- Floor: frequency will not fall below this value.
- Target: run as close to this frequency as possible (overrides EPP and the auto-frequency window).

##### Energy Performance Preference (EPP)

An energy-performance preference from 0 to 255; lower favors performance, higher favors power saving. Requires CPU support for frequency-scaling delegation.

##### Auto Frequency Window

The time window over which the CPU evaluates load and auto-scales frequency; the smaller it is, the faster it reacts. Requires CPU support for frequency-scaling delegation.

##### Extended Virtualization Extensions / Max Hardware-Isolated Guests

Enables hardware isolation for confidential VMs. Requires the CPU to provide confidential-computing capability (Intel TDX / AMD SEV-SNP).

- Extended Virtualization Extensions: enables hardware isolation for confidential VMs.
- Max Hardware-Isolated Guests: limits the number of nested hardware-isolated VMs.

##### CCX per Socket / Processors per L3

Emulates AMD's core-complex (CCX) and L3-sharing topology for the virtual machine. AMD platforms only.

- CCX per Socket: how many core complexes each socket is divided into.
- Processors per L3: how many cores share one L3 domain.

---
### Memory
> [!NOTE]
> The capacity of RAM that the virtual machine can control.

#### Compute Resources

##### Startup RAM

The amount of physical memory the virtual machine must occupy when powered on. If the host lacks sufficient free memory, startup may fail.

If the operating system supports hot adjustment, this value can be modified during runtime to increase or decrease the memory allocation limit.

##### Memory Weight

The priority of multiple virtual machines competing for memory when host physical memory is insufficient.

##### Dynamic Memory

Allows the Hypervisor to scale the allocated memory amount in real-time based on the actual needs inside the virtual machine.

Minimum memory cannot be greater than Startup RAM. The virtual machine will naturally not exceed the maximum memory or the host's physical memory limit.

When using GPU-PV or PCIe Passthrough, Startup RAM must be the same as minimum memory to determine memory address mapping relationships.

#### Advanced Features

##### Memory Page Size

Determines the "granularity" when mapping virtual memory to physical memory. Options: 4K, 2M, 1G. This option requires the host system version to be greater than 26100 and the VM configuration version to be greater than 12.0. It is beneficial for large databases or high-performance computing tasks.

##### Memory Encryption

When enabled, uses hardware features (AMD SEV or Intel TDX) to encrypt memory data in real-time. Even the host cannot read the memory data. Enabling this adds slight memory latency and increased CPU load.

> [!CAUTION]
> The following are experimental features. Use with caution.

##### Memory Mapping Mode
Controls the physical backend allocation method for virtual machine memory. Three modes are available: Physical Mapping Mode, Virtual Mapping Mode, and Hybrid Mapping Mode.

##### Memory Access Monitoring Granularity
Configures the Hypervisor's tracking policy for virtual machine memory read/write behavior, with two dimensions:
- Monitor State: Disable tracking, enable tracking, or configure per processor node.
- Page Granularity: The minimum memory unit for tracking. Options: auto-assign, standard granularity (4KB), large page granularity (2MB), huge page granularity (1GB). Smaller granularity means higher precision but greater overhead.

##### Intel SGX Confidential Computing
Uses Intel SGX to carve out a hardware-level isolated secure Enclave inside the processor. Code and data within the Enclave are completely invisible to the host during runtime.
- Confidential Memory Size: Total physical memory allocated for secure Enclave use, in MB. Minimum 2MB, must be a multiple of 2MB.
- Authorization Control Mode: Controls the Enclave's launch authorization method. No Access means fully controlled by the platform; Read Only means reading the launch control MSR; Read/Write means the VM manages Enclave authorization itself.
- MSR Runtime Control Default: The initial value of the SGX launch control register, a 64-bit hexadecimal string. Only effective when Authorization Control Mode is set to Read/Write.

##### Memory Optimization
Three independent memory performance optimization switches.
- Memory Activity Hints: Reports hot/cold memory page information from inside the VM to the Hypervisor, helping the host make smarter memory reclamation and paging decisions, reducing performance jitter under memory pressure.
- Paravirtualized Paging Optimization: Enables heuristic page faults, where the VM proactively notifies the Hypervisor of page fault events, reducing unnecessary interception overhead and improving throughput for memory-intensive workloads.
- Independent Compressed Memory Pool: Allocates a dedicated memory compression storage area for the VM. When host memory is tight, it prioritizes compression over swapping to disk, reducing memory reclamation latency.

##### NUMA Node Memory Block Limit
Manually limits the maximum number of memory blocks observable on a single virtual NUMA node. Adjusting this value controls the NUMA topology awareness range of the OS inside the VM, avoiding performance degradation caused by cross-node access. When modifying large-page memory configuration, this value is automatically aligned to prevent configuration conflicts.

##### Dynamic Memory Adjustment Stride
Configures the minimum step size for each dynamic memory scaling operation. Options: small page (4KB), large page (2MB), huge page (1GB), or disable alignment constraints. The stride unit should be consistent with the memory page size configuration; otherwise dynamic memory adjustment may fail.

##### Hardware Accelerated Extension (CXL)
- CXL Support: Enables CXL (Compute Express Link) high-speed bus protocol support, allowing the virtual machine to access expanded memory devices mounted via the CXL interface.
- Physical Pinning: Enables GPA Pinning, locking the VM's physical address space in host memory and disabling swapping or migration. Suitable for scenarios with extreme memory latency sensitivity or requiring stable DMA mapping.

---
### Storage
> [!NOTE]
> Local storage media accessible by the virtual machine.

Divided into Virtual Files and Physical Devices. Virtual files can be vhdx, vhd, and iso formats. Physical devices can select offline hard drives or optical drives on the host for passthrough (some USB storage media may not be supported).

The monitoring interface shows real-time read/write rates and capacity changes. The number on the left is the file size, and the number on the right is the capacity limit.

The detail interface allows unmounting, modifying the source, capacity optimization (dynamic disk), and folder location for mounted devices.

#### Slot Configuration

Hyper-V requires you to mount virtual files or physical devices to an IDE Controller or SCSI Controller for VM access. ExHyperV has simplified this operation to automatic allocation, allowing you to care only about the media source without worrying about slot allocation.

If you wish to understand the complex slot logic and configure manually, please refer to the following rules:

· For running Generation 1 VMs, IDE Controllers cannot be uninstalled, but ISOs can be ejected and inserted.

· For Generation 1 VMs, ISOs can only be inserted into IDE Controllers. Gen 1 VMs can only boot from media on IDE Controllers.

· For Generation 2 VMs, SCSI Controllers and the media within them can be ejected and removed at any time, so please operate with caution.

· For Generation 1 VMs, there are a total of 2 IDE Controllers x 2 + 4 SCSI Controllers x 64 = 260 slots available. For Generation 2 VMs, there are a total of 4 SCSI Controllers x 64 = 256 slots available.

#### Media Settings

##### Source

Select a virtual file or an available physical device. Some USB storage media will not appear in the available list because they cannot be taken offline.

##### Virtual Files

###### Type: Hard Disk

When the disk type is Dynamic, the initial file size is small (generated based on block size and capacity for the block allocation table) rather than the full capacity, and it grows gradually.

When the disk type is Fixed, the initial value is the capacity size and does not change; read/write efficiency is higher.

When the disk type is Differencing, you need to specify a dynamic/fixed virtual hard disk to inherit all its parameters.

Sector Format: 512n, 512e (default), 4kn. Corresponding physical sector size and logical sector size are: 512/512, 4096/512, 4096/4096. Ordinary users can keep the default.

Block Size: Minimum storage unit. Larger blocks mean higher read/write efficiency but lower space utilization; smaller blocks mean lower read/write efficiency but higher space utilization.

###### Type: Optical Drive

Created using Windows built-in IMAPI2, using the ISO 9660 + UDF dual-format standard. It quickly packages a specified folder and mounts it to the virtual machine. This feature compensates for Hyper-V's disadvantage in quickly creating ISOs.

---
### Graphics Card
> [!NOTE]
> The ability of the virtual machine to access the host physical graphics card via GPU-PV technology.

GPU-PV is a paravirtualization technology that allows multiple virtual machines to share the computing power of a physical GPU without PCIe Passthrough. GPU-PV is still evolving; the newer the WDDM version, the more complete the functions. The host and VM should use the latest system versions as much as possible.

· The monitoring interface allows viewing the graphics engine utilization of all GPU-PV partitions on that VM, including four common engines: 3D Rendering, Copy, Video Encode, and Video Decode.

· Currently, Hyper-V cannot effectively limit the GPU resources used by each virtual machine. Parameters in `Set-VMGpuPartitionAdapter` do not take effect ([Relevant discussion](https://github.com/jamesstringerparsec/Easy-GPU-PV/issues/298)). Therefore, this tool does not currently provide resource allocation functions.

· Although virtual devices created by GPU-PV can call the physical GPU, they do not fully inherit its hardware characteristics and driver details. Certain software/games relying on specific hardware IDs or driver signatures may not run.

#### System Requirements

Host and VM must be the following versions to enable this capability.

- Windows 10 (Build 17134+)
- Windows 11
- Windows Server 2019
- Windows Server 2022
- Windows Server 2025

· The virtual machine must be a configuration version greater than 9.0 to be assigned a GPU-PV graphics card. There is no restriction on VM generation.

· Virtual machines with GPU-PV enabled do not support the checkpoint function.

· Graphics cards with GPU-PV enabled must exist on the host and cannot be used for PCIe Passthrough simultaneously.

· Multiple GPU-PV graphics partitions obtained from the same graphics card cannot provide computing power exceeding the physical limit.

· A virtual machine can obtain GPU-PV graphics partitions from different graphics cards.

· There may be [memory leak issues](https://github.com/jamesstringer90/Easy-GPU-PV/issues/446). It is recommended to update the host system version to `26100.4946` or above.

#### WDDM Version and GPU-PV Features
> The higher the WDDM (Windows Display Driver Model) version, the more complete the GPU-PV features. It is recommended that both host and VM use the latest Windows versions.

#### How to output video from the VM?

In the GPU-PV model, the VM's GPU-PV card acts as a "Render Device" and needs a "Display Device" to output the image. There are three solutions:

1.  **Microsoft Hyper-V Video (Default)**
    - **Pros**: Works out of the box, good compatibility.
    - **Cons**: Max resolution 1080p, refresh rate approx 60Hz.

2.  **Indirect Display Driver + Streaming (Recommended)**
    - Install [Virtual-Display-Driver](https://github.com/VirtualDrivers/Virtual-Display-Driver) to create a high-performance virtual monitor.
    - Use streaming software like Parsec, Sunshine, or Moonlight. Pair them, set to auto-start, and connect while RDP and other remote desktops are closed to achieve a high-resolution, high-refresh-rate smooth experience.
    - ![Sunshine+PV Example](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e25fce26-6158-4052-9759-6d5d1ebf1c5d)

> [!NOTE]
> Here is a simple Sunshine + GPU-PV guide.

· Add GPU-PV to the virtual machine and ensure it works normally.

· Install [Virtual-Display-Driver](https://github.com/VirtualDrivers/Virtual-Display-Driver) in the virtual machine, and ensure "Generic Monitor (VDD by MTT)" appears in monitors. Set the resolution and refresh rate via display settings.

· Install Sunshine in the virtual machine, and pair Moonlight with Sunshine.

· Set Sunshine to auto-start with administrator privileges.

· Reboot the virtual machine. Do not open the console or any remote desktop.

· Connect to the virtual machine via Moonlight. If all goes well, video and sound will be transmitted to the Moonlight client.

3.  **USB Graphics Card + GPU-PV**
    - **Idea**: Use PCIe Passthrough to assign a USB controller to the VM, then connect a USB graphics card (e.g., based on [DisplayLink DL-6950](https://www.synaptics.com/cn/products/displaylink-graphics/integrated-chipsets/dl-6000) or [Silicon Motion SM768](https://www.siliconmotion.com/product/cht/Graphics-Display-SoCs.html) chips) as the display device.
    - **Status**: This solution may conflict with large memory graphics cards and requires more testing.

#### Configuration Process

##### Environment Preparation

Add registry entries to the host system environment, disable security policies, etc., to avoid VM startup failures after assigning GPU-PV.

##### Power Check

The system optimization in the next step requires the virtual machine to be powered off to proceed.

##### System Optimization

Detect host physical addressing capability, automatically configure MMIO Space, and enable Write Combining cache.

##### Assign Graphics Card

Create a GPU-PV partition for the selected graphics card and assign it to the virtual machine.

##### Driver Installation

This is optional. When adding multiple graphics cards, you can uncheck this to avoid importing drivers every time.

- For Windows VMs, the host driver folder will be fully injected into the VM's specified partition. If it's an Nvidia card, registry fixes will also be added. At the same time, link files for certain driver files will be created in the VM's System32 directory. For specific mapping relationships, refer to [drivermapping.md](https://github.com/Justsenger/ExHyperV/blob/main/doc/drivermapping.md).

- For Linux VMs, an SSH automated flow will be executed for module compilation and driver installation. Systems or kernels outside the compatibility list need more testing.

### Console
> [!NOTE]
> Connects to and displays the virtual machine's screen via the RDP protocol, supporting both Basic Session and Enhanced Session modes.

The console window implements RDP connections based on MsRdpEx, connecting directly to the local Hyper-V virtual machine via `127.0.0.1`.

#### Session Modes

**Basic Session**: Connects via the Hyper-V VMBus channel. Does not rely on the VM's internal network or RDP service, making it suitable for viewing early boot screens before the system has fully started (e.g., BIOS/UEFI, installation interface). Resolution is fixed; clipboard sharing and audio are not supported.

**Enhanced Session**: Connects via the RDP protocol. Requires Remote Desktop Services to be enabled inside the virtual machine (enabled by default on Windows). Supports bidirectional clipboard sharing, custom resolution, audio redirection, and other features, offering an experience closer to local usage.

#### Resolution

Only adjustable in Enhanced Session mode. In Basic Session mode, resolution is determined by the Hyper-V virtual graphics adapter and the internal operating system, and cannot be modified from the console side. To force a specific Basic Session resolution, run the following PowerShell command while the VM is powered off:

```powershell
Set-VMVideo -VMName "VMName" -HorizontalResolution 1920 -VerticalResolution 1080 -ResolutionType Single
```

#### Full Screen Mode

Click the full screen button in the title bar or use the shortcut (Ctrl+Alt+Space) to toggle full screen. In full screen mode, the title bar is hidden and keyboard input is fully captured by the virtual machine. Use the shortcut to exit full screen.

#### Send Ctrl+Alt+Del

The keyboard icon button in the title bar sends the Ctrl+Alt+Del signal to the virtual machine.

---
### Network
> [!NOTE]
> The ability of the virtual machine to access the network via a switch at the data link layer.

#### VLAN and Isolation
> [!NOTE]
> VLAN (Virtual Local Area Network) is a communication technology that logically divides a physical LAN into multiple independent broadcast domains.

Access Mode: Assigns the virtual machine's network adapter to a single VLAN. When VLAN ID equals 0, VLAN function is disabled.

The VLAN ID range is 1-4094. After setting a specific VLAN ID, the virtual machine can only communicate at Layer 2 with devices in the same virtual switch that are in the same VLAN ID.

Trunk Mode: Allows the virtual machine's network adapter to transmit traffic for multiple VLANs simultaneously.

· Native VLAN ID: Used to handle untagged default traffic.

· Allow List: Specifies the range of VLAN IDs allowed through this network card (e.g., 10, 20-30).

Private Mode: Implements further Layer 2 isolation within the same VLAN, often used in multi-tenant or hosting environments.

· Primary ID: Public VLAN identifier the VM belongs to.
· Secondary ID: Internal identifier used to implement subdivision isolation.

Three types:

· Isolated: The VM can only communicate with the gateway; other VMs within the same VLAN cannot access each other.

· Community: VMs within the same community can access each other but cannot communicate with other communities.

· Promiscuous: Can communicate with all VMs under the primary VLAN (usually assigned to gateways or firewalls).

#### Traffic Control (QoS)
> [!NOTE]
> Used to manage VM bandwidth allocation and prevent a single VM from saturating the network channel.

Maximum: The peak speed limit. The bandwidth cap for the VM when the network is idle.

Minimum: Guaranteed floor. When the network is busy, the system prioritizes reserving this bandwidth for the VM.

#### Hardware Acceleration
> [!NOTE]
> Offloads work that originally required host CPU processing to the physical network card hardware to improve performance.

Single Root I/O Virtualization (SR-IOV): Allows the virtual machine to skip the virtual switch and directly "connect" to the hardware resources of the physical network card. This feature requires physical network card support, and SR-IOV must be checked when creating the virtual switch. Enable for server-grade NICs with high performance needs.

Virtual Machine Queue (VMQ): Uses the physical NIC's hardware filtering to pre-classify packets sent to different VMs and deliver them directly to the VM's memory. Enable for 10GbE NICs; recommended to disable for 1GbE NICs or Broadcom NICs.

IPsec Task Offload: Transfers encryption/decryption calculations (IPsec protocol) in network transmission from the CPU to the NIC hardware. Default off is fine; almost useless for most.

#### Security and Monitoring
> [!NOTE]
> Enhances virtual network security isolation and traffic monitoring.

Allow MAC Address Spoofing: Allows the virtual machine to change its network card's MAC address. Usually used when enabling nested virtualization or for certain soft router systems that need to spoof MACs. If not enabled, the VM can only use the unique fixed MAC assigned to it.

DHCP Guard: Prevents the virtual machine from acting as a DHCP server, avoiding network disconnection caused by other devices in the network obtaining incorrect IP addresses from this VM.

Router Guard: Prevents the virtual machine from masquerading as a gateway, maliciously hijacking, or spoofing intranet traffic.

Port Mirroring: Copies traffic from VMs in the Source group to VMs in the Destination group.

Join Source Group: Traffic from this network adapter will be sent to the Destination group network adapters.

Join Destination Group: This network adapter will receive traffic from Source group network adapters.

Storm Threshold: Limits the number of broadcast/multicast packets the VM is allowed to send per second. Setting to 0 means no limit; recommended setting is 500-1000.

### Boot
> [!NOTE]
> Determines the order in which the virtual machine attempts each boot device at startup. Drag up and down to adjust priority.

Generation 1 virtual machines support four fixed boot entry types: DVD Drive, Floppy Disk, Network (PXE), and Hard Drive.

Generation 2 virtual machines are based on UEFI firmware, and boot entries come from actually attached hardware devices, including SCSI hard drives, SCSI optical drives, network adapters (PXE), and the Windows Boot Manager. Boot order is persistently stored in the `.vmgs` file corresponding to the virtual machine. This file has an internal simulated GPT disk structure, fixed at 4097 sectors in size—equivalent to the NVRAM chip on a physical machine—and is used to store firmware state such as Secure Boot certificates and boot order.
### Spacetime
>[!NOTE]
> Manages the virtual machine's checkpoints.

Displays the complete timeline of the virtual machine in a tree structure. Each Spacetime represents a historical state, and the lines between Spacetimes indicate derivation relationships. Click a Spacetime to view details and perform operations. Use the export button to save the current topology diagram as an image file.

The checkpoint toggle at the top controls whether new Spacetimes can be created. Disabling it still allows viewing and operating existing Spacetimes.

#### Spacetime Types
- **Origin**: The initial state of the virtual machine; the root node of the entire tree.
- **Snapshot**: A Spacetime generated each time a state is saved; can be renamed.
- **Current**: The current state of the virtual machine; always located at the end of the tree.

#### Create Spacetime
Two types of snapshot Spacetimes are available:
- **Continuous Spacetime**: Equivalent to a standard checkpoint. Saves both disk and memory states, allowing complete restoration of a running virtual machine.
- **Static Spacetime**: Equivalent to a production checkpoint. Saves only the disk state; the virtual machine does not need to be running to create one, and the file size is smaller.

#### Time Jump
Switches the virtual machine to the selected Spacetime. All modifications in the current Spacetime will be lost. All open Wormholes are automatically closed before jumping.

#### Convergence
Merges the selected Spacetime into its parent, without affecting the topology structure with other Spacetimes.

#### Delete
Deletes the selected Spacetime and all its child Spacetimes.

#### Parallel Universe
Creates an independent new virtual machine instance based on the selected Spacetime. Feature under development.

#### Wormhole
Mounts the disk of the selected Spacetime to the currently running virtual machine without making a Time Jump. All modifications to the mounted disk will not affect the selected Spacetime. Only one Wormhole can be open at a time.

While a Wormhole is open for a selected Spacetime, no other operations can be performed on that Spacetime.

### PCIe Passthrough
> [!NOTE]
> PCIe Passthrough is actually an implementation of DDA (Discrete Device Assignment). For ease of understanding, the name is changed to PCIe Passthrough.

PCIe Passthrough allows removing a complete PCIe device (Graphics Card, Network Card, Sound Card, USB Controller, etc.) from the host and assigning it directly to a virtual machine.

Note: This feature requires the IOMMU switch in the BIOS to be enabled and requires a Server system environment.

#### Assignable Devices

PCIe Passthrough searches for assignable devices by PCIe device. If a device does not appear in the list, it means it does not belong to an independent PCIe device, and you need to try assigning its parent PCIe controller.

#### VM System

Usually use Windows 10/11 or higher. Linux requires further testing.

#### Host System Requirements

- Windows Server 2019
- Windows Server 2022
- Windows Server 2025

**Black Magic**: If you want to use PCIe Passthrough on a non-Server system, you can try toggling the system version switch to change the identifier from WinNT to ServerNT, thereby tricking the Hypervisor. This switch currently only works for the following versions.

Effective Versions: Pro Education, Pro Workstation, Pro Single Language, Pro China, Education, Enterprise LTSC, Enterprise G, Enterprise Multi-Session, IOT Enterprise.

Ineffective Versions: Pro, Home, Enterprise, Home Single Language.

#### Three States of PCIe Devices

1.  **Host State**: The device is normally mounted to the host system and can only be used by the host.
2.  **Dismounted State**: The device has been uninstalled from the host (`Dismount-VMHostAssignableDevice`) but not assigned to a VM. At this point, the device is unavailable in the host Device Manager and needs to be remounted to the host or assigned to a VM.
3.  **Virtual State**: The device has been successfully assigned to a virtual machine.

#### PCIe Partial Graphics Card Compatibility List
> Compatibility performance can only be confirmed after installing drivers in the virtual machine. Welcome to share your test results via [Issues](https://github.com/Justsenger/ExHyperV/issues)!

### Virtual Switch
> [!NOTE]
> Displays the topology and connection status of Hyper-V switches on the host.

ExHyperV redefines Hyper-V's three switch types (External, Internal, Private) into three network modes (Bridged, NAT, No Upstream), where NAT mode integrates ICS functionality.

### Network Modes

Bridged Mode: Host and VM connect under the same external virtual switch, with a specified physical network card providing the outlet network.

NAT Mode: Host and VM connect under the same internal virtual switch. The host shares the physical network card's network to the VM via ICS and is responsible for the upstream outlet, NAT translation, and DHCP. Only one NAT mode network can exist.

No Upstream: Host and VM connect under the same internal virtual switch with no upstream network. The host can choose not to connect to this switch, in which case the virtual switch automatically switches to a Private switch.

· Default Switch belongs to a unique switch type working similarly to NAT mode and automatically switches the upstream network based on metrics.

---
### USB Passthrough
> [!NOTE]
> USB Passthrough is implemented via VMBus + USBIP protocol, not network or RDP forwarding.

USB Passthrough allows assigning a USB device on the host to a virtual machine for exclusive use, without requiring PCIe Passthrough and without IOMMU restrictions.

> [!WARNING]
> This feature is currently in its first phase (proxy solution) and is a beta feature. There may be uncovered scenarios and bugs. Please be aware of the risks before using.

#### How It Works

ExHyperV wraps the USBIP protocol using the af-hyperv protocol within VMBus, establishing a high-performance data channel between the host and the virtual machine without any network configuration.

#### Requirements

**Host**:
- Install [usbipd-win](https://github.com/dorssel/usbipd-win)

**Virtual Machine**:
- Install [usbip-win2](https://github.com/vadimgrn/usbip-win2)
- Download and run the VM agent `USBProxy.exe` from [ExHyperV-USBProxy](https://github.com/Justsenger/ExHyperV-USBProxy/releases/latest)

#### Verified Compatible Devices

| Device Type | Compatibility | Remarks |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| USB Keyboard / Mouse | ✅ | |
| Regular / SSD USB Drive | ✅ | |
| Android Phone | ✅ | |
| USB Camera | ✅ | May have stuttering issues |
| USB Microphone | ✅ | |
| DisplayLink Graphics Card | ✅ | |

> Devices not natively compatible with the USBIP protocol are also not supported by this solution.

#### Usage Notes

- The current version requires ExHyperV to remain running to maintain the USB connection.
- Only the Windows host → Windows VM link is currently maintained. Windows → Linux is theoretically feasible; PRs are welcome at [ExHyperV-USBProxy](https://github.com/Justsenger/ExHyperV-USBProxy/releases/latest).
- ExHyperV must stay running to maintain the USB connection; the forwarding service has not yet been made an independent background service.
- Slim/stripped-down system VMs may be unable to use this feature due to missing required components.
- The next development phase may consider using GPADL memory sharing mechanisms.

### Hyper-V on ARM

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Hyper-V on ARM is supported on Windows ARM devices with Qualcomm Snapdragon processors (8cx series and above).

Hyper-V is currently the most mature virtualization solution on ARM, with functionality largely equivalent to the x86 platform, aside from some known limitations.

Note that due to the Snapdragon 8cx Gen3's 36-bit physical addressing limit (64GB), MMIO space has been specially optimized.

#### Architecture

x86/x64 uses the Ring privilege model, with the OS kernel running at Ring 0. To give the Hypervisor a higher privilege level, Intel and AMD introduced VMX Root Mode outside the Ring model — commonly referred to as "Ring -1".

ARM does not use the Ring model. Instead, it uses Exception Levels:

- **EL0**: User mode
- **EL1**: Kernel mode
- **EL2**: Hypervisor
- **EL3**: Secure Monitor

#### Known Limitations

- Only ARM64 virtual machines are supported. x86/x64 guests cannot run — make sure to use an ARM64 ISO when installing.
- Nested virtualization: not supported. This is a Hyper-V limitation on ARM and is unrelated to hardware capability.
- PCIe passthrough (DDA): not supported. Snapdragon's PCIe root ports lack ACS support, and the SMMU does not expose usable DMA remapping capabilities to Hyper-V.
- Only Generation 2 virtual machines are supported.
